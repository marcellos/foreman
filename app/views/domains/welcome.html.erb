  <p>
  Before you proceed to using Foreman you should provide information about one or more domains.
  <p/>

  <p>
  Foreman considers a domain and a DNS zone as the same thing. That is, if you are planning to manage a site where all the machines are or the form <i>hostname</i>.<b>someware.com</b>
  then the domain is <b>someware.com</b>. This allows Foreman to associate a puppet variable with a domain/site and automatically append this variable to all external node requests made 
  by machines at that site.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>fullname</b> field is used for human readability in reports and other pages that refer to domains.
